Initial Project:
- [ ] Copy the CalcGUI project and determine what buttons need to be present
        -numbers, + -, "Resub", "Tier 1 Gifted", "Tier 2 Gifted", "Tier 3 Gifted", "Bits", "Dono", add user, update user, user search, list refresh (should trigger after adding or updating)
- [ ] Set buttons to calculate properly
- [x] Set a minimum amount to be highlighted as "bumpable"
        -Need to double check this is working properly
- [x] Figure out a way to make it display totals (and separate totals for each user)
        -Need to clean up decimals 
- [x] Set up output format to copy and paste into song request notes

If this works great and I have time:
- [ ] Play around with outputting information to a Google Sheet
- [ ] Use Twitch Livestream Data Scraper by thomasglauser to get a timestamp for the beginning of a stream
- [ ] Set up automation or frequent refreshes

Deliverables:
- [ ] Create PPT Splash screen and upload to D2L (Due 11/30)
- [ ] Record presentation in Teams (Due before the end of Finals)
- [ ] Upload screenshot to D2L (12/15)
